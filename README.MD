Kettlebell Velocity TrackerA client-side web application for tracking kettlebell velocity and detecting anaerobic threshold via velocity drop-off. Uses MediaPipe Pose for keypoint tracking and HTML5 Canvas for visualization.FeaturesReal-time Velocity Tracking: Tracks wrist velocity (m/s) using computer vision.Rep Detection: Automatically counts reps based on velocity profiles.Threshold Detection:Establishes a baseline from the first 3 reps.Monitors percentage drop-off.Alerts at 15% (Yellow) and 20% (Red/Critical).Video Support: Works with live webcam or uploaded video files (30fps/1080p).Offline Capable: All processing happens in the browser; no video is sent to a server.Installation & Deployment1. File StructureAlthough the logic is contained within index.html for ease of testing, the structure for Vercel deployment is:/
├── index.html      # Main Application
├── vercel.json     # Headers for SharedArrayBuffer support
├── README.md
└── .gitignore
2. Deploy to VercelPush this code to a GitHub repository.Import the project into Vercel.Important: The vercel.json file is critical. It sets Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp and Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin. These headers are often required for MediaPipe's WASM backend to use threading for performance.3. UsageAllow Camera: Click "Enable Camera".Calibration: The app assumes a standard shoulder width of 0.4m to calculate real-world velocity. Ensure your full upper body is visible.Baseline Phase: Perform 3 reps with maximum power. The app will calculate your baseline average.Test Phase: Continue performing reps.Green: < 15% drop (Keep going)Yellow: 15-20% drop (Fatigue setting in)Red: > 20% drop (Stop test)Troubleshooting"Error Loading AI": Ensure your browser supports WebGL/WASM. If on mobile, use Safari (iOS) or Chrome (Android).Low FPS: Ensure good lighting. The LITE model is used by default for performance, but older devices may struggle with high-res streams.Velocity seems wrong: The app calculates distance based on shoulder width. If you are standing sideways or very far away, the pixel-to-meter conversion may drift. Face the camera for best results.
